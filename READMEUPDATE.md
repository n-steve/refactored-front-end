Hello Instructor,

I've made an entire 360 change to my Phase3 Project.

I would first like to start off with what I've realized was my huge mistakes.

1. Making sure my endpoint matches the post/patch request from frontend. I've spent way too much time trying to find out how to add new things to the post/patch frontend
   and getting constant errors coming from the backend

2. Learning more about chmod, sudo, and the value of forums. I've learned to never mess with chmod and sudo again, it almost ruined my entire computer.

3. Learning more about how I need to take breaks when I'm working on coding. I spend hours trying to solve a problem. But now, when I take breaks inbetween. I get things done faster and more efficient.

Created a successful migration table and seed
I've made changes to the backend many to many association. connecting each model to each other correctly when called.
The appcontroller matches perfectly and postman requests works.

Frontend React

Here is where I struggle the most. My creativity is not the best. I honestly hate React Semantic UI because of how difficult it is to npm install it and constantly getting user permission errors
I find it hard to think of something new and apply it. I think I am more afraid of being judged too difficult for my amateur work.

I still find it difficult to work with a patch request from frontend trying to get everything to edit correctly and update to the backend!

But in the end I am proud of my work and I should be proud. Imposter Syndrome can kick the bucket!
